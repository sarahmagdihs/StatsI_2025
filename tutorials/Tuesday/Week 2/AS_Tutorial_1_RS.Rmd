```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# Load data 

```{r}
df <- read.csv("datasets/fictional_data.csv")
```

## Introduction

Give a brief introduction of the research question(s), and how you will answer them.

#### Research Question -----------
# Is there a relationship between education and income?

# Selection of variables
# a. Education: University level education in years
# b. Income: Monthly net income
# c. Capital: Whether the person lives in capital or not

## Data

Import the data and describe it. Include below a brief written interpretation. 

```{r}
# Load data 'fictional_data.csv'



#lets look at the data


```

## Analysis

Describe how you analysed the data. You can embed R outputs directly in your text, for example, the mean of university level education is `r round(mean(df$edu),2)` years. 

Present a relevant visualization for the distribution of income. 

```{r}


```

Include some analysis of how confident we can be about our estimate for the population mean.

```{r}

```

Is there a relationship between education and income?

```{r}

```

## Conclusion

What is your main finding? What weaknesses might there be in your research? What further analyses are needed?
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
